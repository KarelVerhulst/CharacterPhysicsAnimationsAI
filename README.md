# CharacterPhysicsAnimationsAI

For school we have an assignement to make a level where a character can walk around.
This character can walk, run, jump and crouch.
He has also some actions like push boxes, click a switch, climb a ladder and pick up a sword.

I used a charactercontroller to make all this happen. Together with animations from [mixamo](mixamo.com).
All the actions and locomotions are physic based.

There is alse a NPC that will do some AI.
For this i used a behaviour tree.
