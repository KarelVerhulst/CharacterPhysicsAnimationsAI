# CharacterPhysicsAnimationsAI

For school we had an assignement to make a level where a character can perform some actions.
This character can walk, run, jump and crouch.
He can also do some actions like pushing a box, clicking a switch, climbing a ladder and picking up a sword.

I used a charactercontroller to make all this happen, together with the animations from [mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com).
All the actions and locomotions are physic based.

There is also a NPC that will do some AI.
For this I used a behaviour tree.
